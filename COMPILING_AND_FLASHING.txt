Below are the old instructions to compile franco.kernel, the process is pretty much the same, with the following changes:
- before compiling: "cd kernel_huawei" and "ln -s config.current .config". This is just because .config is ignored in .gitignore (".*"), I'll tweak it later :)
- in "git clone.." command use "https://github.com/ksatta/kernel_huawei.git"
- build_scripts directory has some scripts I use to automate the building, zipping and copying to phone. You can optionally use those if you want. You can change
the "ksatta" in build.sh to something else to differentiate your builds from others. It's used to create the text in settings/about phone/kernel.
- instead of steps 9 & 10, just cd to the build_scripts/anykernel_zip_template dir.

How to compile and flash franco.kernel (instructions by Kimmo Satta (ksatta))
--------------------------------------------------------------
(In ubuntu 11.04, should work for other distros/ubuntu versions too):

1. get https://sourcery.mentor.com/sgpp/lite/arm/portal/package8736/public/arm-none-eabi/arm-2011.03-42-arm-none-eabi.bin (or latest)

2. shell: "sudo apt-get install git"

3. Create some directory for the kernel sources, cd to it, then in shell: "git clone https://github.com/franciscofranco/u8800-kernel.git"

4. shell:"sudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow dash", choose no from the dialog. (The CodeSourcery installer doesn't support ubuntu 11.04's default shell (dash)).

5. Run CodeSourcery intaller from shell: "sh arm-2011.03-42-arm-none-eabi.bin", choose minimal set, use all other default values.

6. cd to the "u8800-kernel"-directory, it's where you ran git clone.

7. shell:"PATH=$PATH:[codesourcery install dir]/bin" (I did this, but probably not needed when CROSS_COMPILE is used with make).

8. shell:"make CROSS_COMPILE=/store/android/sourcery/bin/arm-none-eabi-".
NOTE: I think this uses too few threads by default for newer CPUs, you can probably build it faster if you use for example -j8. The number is the number of threads used.

9. make a directory for creating the .zip file for flashing the phone. cd to it.

10. shell:"unzip franco.Kernel-31082011.zip" (or use latest .zip)

11. Replace kernel/zImage with your built zImage. The built zImage is in "[franco.kernel sources dir]/u8800-kernel/arch/arm/boot".

12. Create a zip to flash to the phone. Shell (in the directory you created in step 9):"zip -r foo.zip *". You can check with unzip -l that the directory structure is right. It should contain "kernel/.." and "META-INF/...".

12. Boot phone into recovery, flash your new zip, and test if it works. "Settings/About phone" should now show [your username]@[your hostname] under Kernel version

13. Modify the kernel in some cool way and share it to the community :)
